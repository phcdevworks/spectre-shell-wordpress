# Vite WordPress Theme Builder Template

This directory is a **TEMPLATE** for creating WordPress themes with Vite.

## Quick Start

1. Customize `style.css` with your theme details
2. Replace `spectre_shell` prefix in `functions.php` with your theme slug
3. Modify templates (index.php, header.php, footer.php) as needed
4. Run `npm run dev` in the project root during development
5. Run `npm run build` before deploying

## What Gets Deployed

Deploy this entire `spectre-theme/` folder to your WordPress installation:

```
wp-content/themes/your-theme-name/
```

The `dist/` folder will be auto-generated by Vite with your compiled assets.
